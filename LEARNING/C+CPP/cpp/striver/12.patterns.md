Patterns

Nested Loops

1.Outer loops is for rows here count the no of lines
2.inner loop is for columns, focus on the columns & connect them to the rows
3.Print whatever you are printing inside the for loop
4.Oberve symmetry where required

Example: 1

Output: \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \*

Evaluate:
here we obersve that in 0 row we get four '_'
1 row we get four '_'
2 row we get four '_'
3 row we get four '_'

1. How many rows are there? 4
2. How many columns are there? 4
3. What is the pattern?
4. What is the symmetry?

Code:
for i in range(4):
for j in range(4):
print("\*", end=" ")
print()

Important: Usually in online CP compilers we dont write everything in the int main function instead we create function for each n everyone.
So in the above written program we might create a void function for that and put it there and simply call it in the int main function. In addition to this there are mutiple test cases in online CP compiler, keeping that in mind we might have to take input from the user and then according to that give the output. And sometimes the test cases might take multiple inputs simultaneously in one go so like:
int main() {
int t;
cin >> t;
for (int i=0; i<t; i++) {
int n;
cin >> n;
// calling the function here
}
}
Now all this will run internally which will not be visible to the user only the program function is used in the compiler

Example 2

Output: \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \*

Evaluate:
here we obersve that in 0 row we get one '_'
1st row we get two '_'
2nd row we get three '_'
3rd row we get four '_'
4th row we get five '\*'

1. How many rows are there? 5
2. How many columns are there? 5
3. What is the pattern? - increasing traingle pattern
4. What is the symmetry? -

Code:
for i in range(5):
for j in range(<=i):
print("\*", end=" ")
print()

Example 3

Output: 1
1 2
1 2 3
1 2 3 4
1 2 3 4 5

Evaluate:
here we obersve that in 0 row we get one '1'
1st row we get two '1 2'
2nd row we get three '1 2 3'
3rd row we get four '1 2 3 4'
4th row we get five '1 2 3 4 5'

1. How many rows are there? 5
2. How many columns are there? 5
3. What is the pattern? - increasing traingle pattern
4. What is the symmetry? -

Code:
for i in range(5):
for j in range(<=i):
print(j, end=" ")
print()

Example 4

Output: 1
2 2
3 3 3
4 4 4 4
5 5 5 5 5

Evaluate:
here we obersve that in 0 row we get '1'
1st row we get '2 2'
2nd row we get '3 3 3'
3rd row we get '4 4 4 4'
4th row we get '5 5 5 5 5'

1. How many rows are there? 5
2. How many columns are there? 5
3. What is the pattern? - increasing traingle pattern
4. What is the symmetry? -

Code:
for i in range(5):
for j in range(<=i):
print(i, end=" ")
print()

Example 5

Output: \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \*

Evaluate:
here we obersve that in 0 row we get five '_'
1st row we get four '_'
2nd row we get three '_'
3rd row we get two '_'
4th row we get one '\*'

1. How many rows are there? 5
2. How many columns are there? 5
3. What is the pattern? - decreasing traingle pattern
4. What is the symmetry? -

Code:
for i in range(5):
for j in range(5-i+1):
print("\*", end=" ")
print()

Example 6

Output: 1 2 3 4 5
1 2 3 4
1 2 3
1 2
1

Evaluate:
here we obersve that in 0 row we get '1 2 3 4 5'
1st row we get '1 2 3 4'
2nd row we get '1 2 3'
3rd row we get '1 2'
4th row we get '1'

1. How many rows are there? 5
2. How many columns are there? 5
3. What is the pattern? - decreasing traingle pattern
4. What is the symmetry? -

Code:
for i in range(5):
for j in range(5-i+1):
print(j, end=" ")
print()

Example 7

Output: \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \*

Evaluate:
lets understand this first now follwing rule 2 about conneting the columns to rows somehow
here we obersve that in 0 row we are printing 4space, 1 '_', and again 4 space
1st row we are printing 3space, 3 '_', and again 3 space
2nd row we are printing 2space, 5 '_', and again 2 space
3rd row we are printing 1space, 7 '_', and again 1 space
4th row we are printing 0space, 9 '\*', and again 0 space

so it is space stars space
for space we can use n-i-1
for stars we can use 2\*i+1
then again for space we can use n-i-1

Code:
for i in range(5):
for j in range(5-i-1):
print(" ", end="")
for j in range(2*i+1):
print("*", end="")
for j in range(5-i-1):
print(" ", end="")
print()
