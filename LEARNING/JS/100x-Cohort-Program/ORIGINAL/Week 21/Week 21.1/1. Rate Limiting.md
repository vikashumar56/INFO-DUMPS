# Rate Limiting, DDoS and Captcha

## What is Rate Limiting?

A strategy used to control the amount of incoming and outgoing traffic to or from a network.

### Understanding Problem

- Prevent Overload: Hackers can send a large number of requests to a server in a short period of time, which can cause the server to crash.

- Mitigation Abuse: Without rate limiting, users can abuse the system by sending a large number of spam requests in a short period of time.

- Managing Traffic: In high-traffic scenarios, like ticket sales for a popular event, rate limiting can help manage the load on a server.

- Avoid DDoS Attacks: DDoS attacks can be used to overwhelm a server with requests from multiple sources (**distributed** denial of service).

- Rate limiting can be used to prevent this from happening.

### Basic Preventions

- Rate Limiting based on IPs: One downside -> If multiple users are using the same IP, they will all be affected by the rate limit.

- Rate Limiting based on User-IDs: This is a better approach as it is more specific.

### Some Places that require heavy rate limiting

- Login Pages - To prevent brute force attacks.
- OTP Verification Pages - Hackers can write a script to try out all possible OTPs.

## Implementing a Simple Reset Password Endpoint

1. Go to `pen-testing` directory and check the `/backend` folder.

<br>

2. Check the `src/index1.ts` code to see the implementation of the reset password endpoint.

   <details>
   <summary><b>Explaining Endpoints</b></summary>

   - `/generate-otp`: This endpoint is used to generate an OTP for a user. Takes email as input.
   - `/reset-password`: This endpoint is used to reset the password of a user. Takes email, otp and new password as input. Compares the OTP with the one stored in the database.
   </details>

<br>

3. Run the backend server using `npm run without-rl`.

<br>

4. Open Postman and send a POST request to `http://localhost:3000/generate-otp` with the following body:

   ```json
   {
     "email": "test@gmail.com"
   }
   ```

5. Check the logs in the terminal to see the OTP generated.

<br>

6. Send a POST request to `http://localhost:3000/reset-password` with the following body:

   ```json
   {
     "email": "test@gmail.com",
     "otp": "[OTP_GENERATED]",
     "password": "newpassword"
   }
   ```

## Implementing Hacker's Code

> **Short Hack**: In postman, you can export the request in any language of your choice by clicking on the code button on right side of the screen.

1. Go to `pen-testing/attack` folder.

<br>

2. Check the `src/index1.ts` code to see the implementation of the hacker's code.

   <details>
   <summary><b>Explaining Code</b></summary>

   - The entire code logic is pasted from postman.
   - `axios.request`: This is another method to make a request using axios when we have put the configuration in an object.

   </details>

<br>

3. Write a basic script to send multiple requests to the `/reset-password` endpoint.

   ```typescript
   for (let i = 100000; i <= 999999; i++) {
     console.log('Sending request for OTP:', i);
     sendRequest(i.toString()); //function sending the req taking otp in token
   }
   ```

<br>

### Optimizing Sending Request: Batching Requests

**Why?**

- Sending requests one by one can be slow and inefficient.
- We can split the requests into batches and send them in parallel to speed up the process.

**Implementation** ðŸ‘‡

1. We split the requests into batches of 1000 requests each.

   ```typescript
   for (let i = 100000; i <= 999999; i += 1000) {
     console.log('Sending request for OTP:', i, 'to', i + 999);

     for (let j = i; j <= i + 999; j++) {
       sendRequest(j.toString());
     }
   }
   ```

2. But before this, we must ensure that all of the requests are sent in parallel. When all of them succeed, we can move to the next batch.

   ```typescript
   ...
   const promises = [];
   for (let j = i; j <= i + 999; j++) {
       promises.push(sendRequest(j.toString()));
   }

   await Promise.all(promises);
   ```

3. Try running the hacker's code using `npm run local-attack`.

<br>

4. Check the server logs to see which after how many requests the otp request succeeds.

   <br>

   > Note: Make sure to generate an otp using the `/generate-otp` endpoint on postman before.

## Exploiting a Production Server

1. Go to [100x devs classx website](https://harkirat.classx.co.in/new-courses).

2. Open the network tab in the developer tools.

3. Click on the `Reset Password` button.

4. Check the network tab to see the request being made to verify the otp.

5. Copy the request as a cURL command.

6. Go to `Postman -> File -> Import` and paste the copied cURL command.

7. Your request will be imported in Postman.

8. Click on the `Code` button on the right side of the screen. Select the language as `Node.js` and copy the code.

10. Copy the code and paste it in the `pen-testing/attack/src/index2.ts` file.

11. Modify the request to accept multiple OTPs.

12. Run the attack's code using `npm run prod-attack`.

    > Note: Make sure to generate an otp by going to the website and clicking on the `Reset Password` button.

13. Check the server logs to see the requests being made.

**Expected Behaviour**: The server should block the requests after a certain number of requests.

## Implementing Rate Limiting in our Local Backend

1. Install library [express-rate-limit](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-rate-limit).

2. Create seperate middlewares containing rate-limiting logic for each `/generate-otp` and `/reset-password`.

3. Add the middlewares to the respective routes.

4. or just go to the `pen-testing/backend/src/index2.ts` file.

5. Run the backend with rate limiting enabled using `npm run with-rl`.

6. Test the rate limiting by sending multiple requests to the `/reset-password` endpoint using `npm run local-attack` command from `/pen-testing/attack` terminal.

<br>

   ### <p align="center">Congratulations! You have successfully implemented rate limiting on your backend. </p>
