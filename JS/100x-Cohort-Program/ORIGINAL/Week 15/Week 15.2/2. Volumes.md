## What are Volumes?

Volumes are used to ðŸ‘‡
- persist data generated by and used by Docker containers.
- share data between containers and the host machine.
- to persist data even after the container is stopped or removed.

---

## Using containers without volumes

1. Try running a `mongodb` container:

   ```bash
   docker run -d -p 27017:27017 --name=100x-mongo mongo:latest
   ```

   <br>

2. Open your mongodb atlas client and make some changes to the database.

   <br>

3. Stop the `mongodb` container:

   ```bash
   docker stop 100x-mongo
   ```

4. Restart the `mongodb` container:

   ```bash
   docker start 100x-mongo
   ```

5. To persist the data, we need to use volumes.

## Using Volumes to persist data

1. Try running a `mongodb` container with a volume this time:

   ```bash
   docker run -d -p 27017:27017 --name=100x-mongo -v 100x-mongo-data:/data/db mongo:latest
   ```

   <summary>Understanding the command in detail</summary>

   - `-v`: This flag is used to create a volume. It takes the name of the volume as an argument.
   - `100x-mongo-data`: This is the name of the volume.
   - `:/data/db`: This is the path inside the container where the volume will be mounted.
   </details>

2. Open your mongodb atlas client and make some changes to the database.

3. Stop and Restart the `mongodb` container to see now the data is persisted.

## Other useful commands

- To list all the volumes:

  ```bash
  docker volume ls
  ```

- To inspect a volume:

  ```bash
  docker volume inspect 100x-mongo-data
  ```

- To remove a volume:

  ```bash
   docker volume rm 100x-mongo-data
  ```
