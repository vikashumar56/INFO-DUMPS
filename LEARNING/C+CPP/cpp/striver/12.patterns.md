# Understanding Patterns

## Nested Loops

1. The outer loop is for rows; here count the number of lines.
2. The inner loop is for columns; focus on the columns & somehow connect them to the rows.
3. Print whatever you are printing inside the inner loop.
4. Observe symmetry where required.

## Pattern Examples

### Example 1: Simple Square Pattern

**Output:**
```
* * * *
* * * *
* * * *
* * * *
```

**Evaluate:**
Here we observe that:
- in 0 row we get four '*'
- 1st row we get four '*'
- 2nd row we get four '*'
- 3rd row we get four '*'

1. How many rows are there? 4
2. How many columns are there? 4
3. What is the pattern? Square
4. What is the symmetry? Perfect square

**Code:**
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

void squarePattern(int n) {
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            cout << "* ";
        }
        cout << endl;
    }
}
```
## Important Notes for Competitive Programming

1. In online CP compilers, it's common to create separate functions for each pattern rather than writing everything in the main function.
2. Consider multiple test cases:
   ```cpp
   #include <iostream>
   using namespace std;

   void patternFunction(int n) {
       // Pattern logic here
   }

   int main() {
       int t;
       cin >> t;
       while (t--) {
           int n;
           cin >> n;
           patternFunction(n);
       }
       return 0;
   }
   
   //OR
   
   int main() {
      int t;
      cin >> t;
      for (int i = 0; i < t; i++) {
        int n;
        cin >> n;
        // Call the pattern function here
      }
   }
   ```
3. The main function handles input/output, while the pattern logic is in separate functions.
4. Only the function output is visible to the user in the compiler.

### Example 7: Pyramid Pattern

**Output:**
```
    *
   ***
  *****
 *******
*********
```

**Evaluate:**
Let's understand this first. Now following rule 2 about connecting the columns to rows somehow:
- Here we observe that in 0 row we are printing 4 spaces, 1 '*', and again 4 spaces
- 1st row we are printing 3 spaces, 3 '*', and again 3 spaces
- 2nd row we are printing 2 spaces, 5 '*', and again 2 spaces
- 3rd row we are printing 1 space, 7 '*', and again 1 space
- 4th row we are printing 0 spaces, 9 '*', and again 0 spaces

So it is space, stars, space:
- For space, we can use n-i-1
- For stars, we can use 2*i+1
- Then again for space, we can use n-i-1

1. How many rows are there? 5
2. How many columns are there? 9 (at the base)

    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        //space
        for (int j = 0; j < n - i - 1; j++) {
            cout << " ";
        }
        //star
        for (int j = 0; j < 2 * i + 1; j++) {
            cout << "*";
        }
        cout << endl;
    }
}
//OR
void pyramid(int n) {
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        //space
        for (int j = 0; j < n - i - 1; j++) {
            cout << " ";
        }
        //star
        for (int j = 0; j < 2 * i + 1; j++) {
            cout << "*";
        }
        //space
        for(int j = 0;  j<n-i-1; j++) {
            cout << " ";
        }
        cout << endl;
    }
}
```
