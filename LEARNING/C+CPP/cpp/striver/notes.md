### Explanation of Input Validation and Error Handling

When I mentioned that the program does not perform any error checking on user input, I meant that it assumes the user will always provide valid input in the correct format. However, in reality, users can make mistakes, so it's essential to handle such situations gracefully.

#### Issues with the Current Implementation

- **Invalid Input Type**: The program expects the user to enter integer values. If the user enters a non-integer value (e.g., a string or a floating-point number), the program will behave unexpectedly. This can lead to crashes, incorrect results, or infinite loops.

- **Out-of-Range Values**: The program doesn't verify if input values are within a valid range. For instance, very large or very small integer inputs might disrupt the program's logic or cause overflow errors.

- **Insufficient Input**: The program anticipates a specific number of values (5 for the 1D array and 15 for the 2D array). If the user enters fewer values than expected, the program will either indefinitely wait for additional input or crash.

#### Recommendations for Improvement

To address these issues, implement input validation and error handling mechanisms within your program. Here are some effective strategies:

### Input Validation Techniques

- **Using `cin.fail()`**: Check if the input operation fails using `cin.fail()`. If true, clear the error flag with `cin.clear()` and prompt the user to re-enter the input.

- **Employing `cin.good()`**: Verify if the input operation was successful with `cin.good()`. If false, prompt the user to retry entering the input.

- **Utilizing `std::getline()`**: Read input as a string using `std::getline()` and subsequently parse the string to extract the desired input type (e.g., integer).

- **Using `std::stoi()` or `std::stol()`**: Convert a string to an integer using these functions and handle any exceptions that may occur during the conversion process.

### Example Implementation

```cpp
int value;
while (!(cin >> value)) {
    cout << "Invalid input. Please enter an integer value: ";
    cin.clear(); // Clear error flag
    cin.ignore(numeric_limits<streamsize>::max(), '\n'); // Ignore remaining input
}
```

By incorporating these input validation and error handling techniques, your program will become more robust and user-friendly.

### Error Notification

```
In function ‘int mini(int, int)’:
jspwTest.cpp:17:1: warning: control reaches end of non-void function [-Wreturn-type]
   17 | }
```
