## What are Layers in Docker?

- **Layers** are the building blocks of Docker images.
- Each layer is a set of changes to the filesystem.

---

## How Layers are made?

- **Base Image**: The first layer is the base image. It is the foundation of the image.
- **Dockerfile Commands**: Each command in the Dockerfile adds a new layer to the image.

---

## Layers Features

1. **Union File System**: Docker uses a Union File System to combine layers into a single image.
2. **Copy-on-write**: When you run a container, Docker uses a copy-on-write strategy to create a new container layer from the image layers.
3. **Layer Caching**: Docker caches layers to speed up the build process.
4. **Layer Reuse**: If you build a new image from an existing image, Docker reuses the layers from the existing image.
5. **Layer Sharing**: If you push an image to a registry, Docker only pushes the layers that are not already in the registry.
6. **Layer Immunity**: Once a layer is created, it is immutable. You cannot change a layer once it is created.

## Seeing Layers in Action

0. Create a Dockerfile with following content:

   ```Dockerfile
    FROM node:alpine

    WORKDIR /app

    COPY . .

    RUN npm install
    RUN npm run build
    RUN npx prisma generate

    CMD ["node", "index.js"]
   ```

 <br>

1. Run the following command to create a new image from inside the `base-image` directory:

   ```bash
   docker build -t 100x-node .
   ```

   > Notice how Docker creates a new layer for each command in the Dockerfile.

   <br>

2. Run the following command to see the layers in the image:

   ```bash
   docker history 100x-node
   ```

   > Notice how each command in the Dockerfile shows a creation of a new layer in the logs.

3. Try running the build command again.

   > Notice how Docker reuses the layers from the cache.
   
   <br>

   **Diving Deeper**
   Try changing the `src/index.ts` file and running the build command again.
   > Notice how Docker reuses the layers from the cache until the `COPY` command. This is because the `COPY` command invalidates the cache.

## Why are Layers Important?

- Layers Reusing: Layers are reused across images and builds **which makes the build process faster**.

- Layer Caching: Docker caches layers to speed up the build process.

---

## Optimizing Dockerfile

- In the previous Dockerfile, we have used `COPY . .` which copies all the files from the current directory to the image. This is not efficient because it copies all the files including the node_modules.

- But the major problem is that if we change a single file in the project, Docker will invalidate the cache and will rebuild the image from scratch.

- To solve this problem, we can copy the files which don't change often first (`package.json`, `package-lock.json`, `prisma`) and then run `npm install` and `npm run build` commands. Then we can copy the rest of the files.

  ```Dockerfile
  # Cached part
  FROM node:alpine
  WORKDIR /usr/src/app

  COPY package* .
  COPY ./prisma .

  RUN npm install
  RUN npx prisma generate

  # Uncached part
  COPY . .
  RUN npm run build

  EXPOSE 3000

  CMD ["node", "dist/index.js"]
  ```

- Now, if we change a file in the project, **Docker will only rebuild the last two layers**.

- This is a _good practice_ to optimize the Dockerfile and make the build process faster.
