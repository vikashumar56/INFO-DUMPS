- Rate Limiting can still not prevent DDoS attacks.
- DDoS attacks can be used to overwhelm a server with requests from multiple sources (**distributed** denial of service).

- There are many services that offer DDoS protection like Cloudflare, AWS Shield, etc.

## Saving Critical Endpoints from DDoS Attacks

### Method 1: Using Captchas

<p align="center"><img width="600" alt="Screenshot 2024-04-20 at 8 31 16 PM" src="https://github.com/its-id/100x-Cohort-Programs/assets/60315832/3fd5a290-361c-40f1-853e-309939d5b0ba"></p>


1. Go to the [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/en-in/) dashboard.

2. Click on `TurnStile` tab.

3. Add your site and domain for which you want to add the captcha.

4. You will have your site `key` and `secret` generated for you.

5. Now, create a new frontend react project or just go to `/using-captcha/src/App.tsx`.

6. Install the following packages:

   ```bash
   npm install axios react-turnstile
   ```

7. Create a new file `src/App.tsx` and add the following line:

   ```tsx
   import { Turnstile } from '@marsidev/react-turnstile'

   ...
    <Turnstile
        onSuccess={(token) => {
        setToken(token);
        }}
        siteKey='0x4AAAAAAAXtEe2JIeAEUcjX'
    />
   ...
   ```

8. In the backend (`/pen-testing/backend/index2.ts`), add the following line to check if the token is valid:

   ```ts
   ...
   const SECRET_KEY = "your_site_secret";
   ...

   app.post('/reset-password', async (req, res) => {

    ...
    const { ... , token } = req.body;

    let formData = new FormData();
    formData.append('secret', SECRET_KEY);
    formData.append('response', token);

    const url = 'https://challenges.cloudflare.com/turnstile/v0/siteverify';
    const result = await fetch(url, {
        body: formData,
        method: 'POST',
    });
        const challengeSucceeded = (await result.json()).success;

        if (!challengeSucceeded) {
        return res.status(403).json({ message: "Invalid reCAPTCHA token" });
    }
    ...

   })

   ```

9. Run the backend by opening `/pen-testing/backend` in terminal:

   ```bash
   npm run with-rl
   ```

10. Run the frontend by opening `/using-captcha` in terminal:

    ```bash
     npm run dev
    ```

11. Now, go to `http://localhost:3000/` and try to reset the password.

12. You will see a captcha that you need to solve to reset the password.

### <p align="center">Congratulations! You have enabled captcha! on your site! </p>

### Method 2: Using Cloudflare proxies

**How these services work?**

- They come as a proxy in front of your server.
- Thus, All of the traffic goes through them.
- Internally, they perform the logic to check if the traffic is legitimate or not.

**How to use proxies in Cloudflare?**

1. Unfortunately, Cloudflare only provides proxies to domains that are hosted on their servers.

2. Steps are simple: Go to the [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/en-in/) dashboard.

3. Click on `Add a site` and add your domain.

4. Proxy your site through Cloudflare.

5. Generally, this much is enough, but if you want more security you can also add `Rate Limiting` and `Firewall Rules`.
