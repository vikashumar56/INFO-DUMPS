Time Complexity
The difference between Time Compelxity and time taken

Big O Notation- O()

O(N)
for(i=1; i=N; i++) {
cout << "Hello";
}

Best Case, Average Case and Worst Case
Best Case: - O(1)
Average Case: - O(N)
Worst Case: - O(N)

TC, worst case scenario: -Avoid Constants
-Avoid lower values
why?
because it has very less significance

Big - O - Highest or the highest or upper band complexity
& Theta - Average Complexity
& Omega - Lower band Complexity

Question:

1.        for(int i=0; i<N; i++) {
            for (int j=0; j<N; j++)
            {
                //Block of code
            }
        }

    Evaluate: in the outer for loop i is iterating N times then the inner loop is also iterating for N times so it is running for N x N = N^2

2.  for(int i=0; i<N; i++) {
    for (int j=0; j<=i; j++) {
    //Block of code
    }
    }
