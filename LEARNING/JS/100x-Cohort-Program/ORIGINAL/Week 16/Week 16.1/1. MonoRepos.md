## What is a MonoRepo?

- A single repo where all the code for a project is stored.
- This is a common practice in the industry and is used by companies like Google, Facebook, and Twitter.
- It is a way to manage all the code for a project in one place.

## Why use MonoRepos?

- Easier to **manage and maintain the codebase**.
- Easier to **share code** between different parts of the project.
- Easier to **manage dependencies and version control**.
- Easier to **manage the build process and deployment**.
- Easier to **manage the testing and debugging process**.
- Easier to **manage the documentation and the code review process**.

## Common MonoRepos Folder Practices

**When to store in a single folder**:

- If the project structure is simple (like seperated frontend and backend).
- If the code is not shared between different parts of the project.

**When to store in multiple folders**:

- If the project structure is complex (like a microservice architecture).
- If the project structure is complex and the code is shared between different parts of the project.
