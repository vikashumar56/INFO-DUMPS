# Understanding Patterns

## Nested Loops

1. The outer loop is for rows; here count the number of lines.
2. The inner loop is for columns; focus on the columns & somehow connect them to the rows.
3. Print whatever you are printing inside the inner loop.
4. Observe symmetry where required.

## Pattern Examples

### Example 1: Simple Square Pattern

**Output:**

```
* * * *
* * * *
* * * *
* * * *
```

**Evaluate:**
Here we observe that:

- in 0 row we get four '\*'
- 1st row we get four '\*'
- 2nd row we get four '\*'
- 3rd row we get four '\*'

1. How many rows are there? 4
2. How many columns are there? 4
3. What is the pattern? Square
4. What is the symmetry? Perfect square

**Code:**

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

void squarePattern(int n) {
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            cout << "* ";
        }
        cout << endl;
    }
}
```

## Important Notes for Competitive Programming

1. In online CP compilers, it's common to create separate functions for each pattern rather than writing everything in the main function.
2. Consider multiple test cases:

   ```cpp
   #include <iostream>
   using namespace std;

   void patternFunction(int n) {
       // Pattern logic here
   }

   int main() {
       int t;
       cin >> t;
       while (t--) {
           int n;
           cin >> n;
           patternFunction(n);
       }
       return 0;
   }

   //OR

   int main() {
      int t;
      cin >> t;
      for (int i = 0; i < t; i++) {
        int n;
        cin >> n;
        // Call the pattern function here
      }
   }
   ```

3. The main function handles input/output, while the pattern logic is in separate functions.
4. Only the function output is visible to the user in the compiler.

### Example 7: Pyramid Pattern

**Output:**

```
    *
   ***
  *****
 *******
*********
```

**Evaluate:**
Let's understand this first. Now following rule 2 about connecting the columns to rows somehow:

- Here we observe that in 0 row we are printing 4 spaces, 1 '\*', and again 4 spaces
- 1st row we are printing 3 spaces, 3 '\*', and again 3 spaces
- 2nd row we are printing 2 spaces, 5 '\*', and again 2 spaces
- 3rd row we are printing 1 space, 7 '\*', and again 1 space
- 4th row we are printing 0 spaces, 9 '\*', and again 0 spaces

So it is space, stars, space:

- For space, we can use n-i-1
- For stars, we can use 2\*i+1
- Then again for space, we can use n-i-1
  Example: For n = 5 it will be 5-0-1 = 4 spaces and 2\*0+1 = 1 star and then again 5-0-1 = 4 spaces

1. How many rows are there? 5
2. How many columns are there? 9 (at the base)
3. What is the pattern? Pyramid
4. What is the symmetry? Centered pyramid

**Code:**

```cpp
void pyramid(int n) {
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        //space
        for (int j = 0; j < n - i - 1; j++) {
            cout << " ";
        }
        //star
        for (int j = 0; j < 2 * i + 1; j++) {
            cout << "*";
        }
        cout << endl;
    }
}
//OR
void pyramid(int n) {
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        //space
        for (int j = 0; j < n - i - 1; j++) {
            cout << " ";
        }
        //star
        for (int j = 0; j < 2 * i + 1; j++) {
            cout << "*";
        }
        //space
        for(int j = 0;  j<n-i-1; j++) {
            cout << " ";
        }
        cout << endl;
    }
}
```

### Example 8: Reverse Pyramid Pattern

**Output:**

```
*********
 *******
  *****
   ***
    *
```

**Evaluate:**

Let's understand this first. Now following rule 2 about connecting the columns to rows somehow:

- Here we observe that in 0 row we are printing 0 space, 9 '\*', and again 0 space
- 1st row we are printing 1 space, 7 '\*', and again 1 space
- 2nd row we are printing 2 spaces, 5 '\*', and again 2 spaces
- 3rd row we are printing 3 spaces, 3 '\*', and again 3 spaces
- 4th row we are printing 4 spaces, 1 '\*', and again 4 spaces

So it is space, stars, space:

- For space, we can use i
- For stars, we can use 2n-(2\*i+1)
- Then again for space, we can use i
  Example: For n=5 it will be 0 space then 2*5-(2*0+1) = 9 stars in the i=0 row and so on

1. How many rows are there? 5
2. How many columns are there? 9 (at the base)
3. What is the pattern? Pyramid
4. What is the symmetry? Centered pyramid

**Code:**

```cpp
void pyramid(int n) {
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        //space
        for (int j = 0; j < i; j++) {
            cout << " ";
        }
        //star
        for (int j = 0; j < 2*n - (2*i+1); j++) {
            cout << "*";
        }
        //space
        for(int j = 0;  j<i; j++) {
            cout << " ";
        }
        cout << endl;
    }
}
```

### Example 9: Diamond Pattern(Combination of 7 & 8)

Output: \*
**\*
\*\*\***

---

---

---

    *****
     ***
      *

**Evaluate:**
This pattern is a combination of the Pyramid Pattern (Example 7) and the Reverse Pyramid Pattern (Example 8). We can observe that:

- The first half of the pattern is the Pyramid Pattern, where the number of stars increases from 1 to 9 in a centered alignment.
- The second half of the pattern is the Reverse Pyramid Pattern, where the number of stars decreases from 9 to 1 in a centered alignment.

1. How many rows are there? 9
2. How many columns are there? 9 (at the base)
3. What is the pattern? Diamond Pattern
4. What is the symmetry? Centered diamond shape

**Code:**

```cpp
void diamondPattern(int n) {
    // Print the Pyramid Pattern (first half)
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        // Space
        for (int j = 0; j < n - i - 1; j++) {
            cout << " ";
        }
        // Star
        for (int j = 0; j < 2 * i + 1; j++) {
            cout << "*";
        }
        cout << endl;
    }

    // Print the Reverse Pyramid Pattern (second half)
    for (int i = n - 2; i >= 0; i--) {
        // Space
        for (int j = 0; j < n - i - 1; j++) {
            cout << " ";
        }
        // Star
        for (int j = 0; j < 2 * i + 1; j++) {
            cout << "*";
        }
        cout << endl;
    }
}
```

### Example 10: (similar to pattern 2 & 5 )

Output:

*
**
***
****
*****
****
***
**
*


- **Evaluate:**

* The outer loop runs for `2*n-1` rows, where `n` is the number of rows in the top half of the pattern.
* In the first `n` rows, the number of stars printed is equal to the row number (1 star in the first row, 2 stars in the second row, and so on).
* After the `n`th row, the number of stars printed decreases by one in each subsequent row, forming the bottom half of the hourglass pattern.

1. How many rows are there? `2*n-1`
2. How many columns are there? `n` (at the widest part)
3. What is the pattern? Hourglass pattern
4. What is the symmetry? Vertically symmetric

**Code:**

````cpp
void hourglassPattern(int n) {
    for (int i = 1; i <= 2 * n - 1; i++) {
        int stars = i;
        if (i > n)
            stars = 2 * n - i;
        for (int j = 0; j < stars; j++) {
            cout << "*";
        }
        cout << endl;
    }
}


### Example 11:
1
0 1
1 0 1
0 1 0 1
1 0 1 0 1


**Evaluate:**
- The pattern alternates between starting with 1 and 0 in each row.
- Even rows (0, 2, 4, ...) start with 1, and odd rows (1, 3, 5, ...) start with 0.
- The number of elements in each row is equal to the row number.
- The pattern follows a left-aligned triangle shape.

1. How many rows are there? `n`
2. How many columns are there? `n` (in the last row)
3. What is the pattern? Alternating 0-1 triangle pattern
4. What is the symmetry? Left-aligned triangle

**Code:**
```cpp
void alternating01Triangle(int n) {
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        // Determine the starting value for the current row
        int start = i % 2;

        for (int j = 0; j <= i; j++) {
            cout << start;
            // Toggle the value between 0 and 1 for the next element
            start = 1 - start;
        }
        cout << endl;
    }
}
//OR
for (int i=0; i<n; i++) {
    if(i%2==0)
    start=1;
    else
    start 0;
    for (int j=0; j<=i; j++) {
        cout << start;
        start = 1-start;
    }
    cout << endl;
}

Explanation:
- The outer loop iterates over the rows from 0 to n-1.
- For each row, the starting value is determined based on whether the row number is even or odd.
- The inner loop iterates from 0 to the current row number, printing the current value and toggling it between 0 and 1 for the next element.
- After printing each row, a newline is printed to move to the next line.


### Example 12:

Output:
1             1
1 2         2 1
1 2 3     3 2 1
1 2 3 4 4 3 2 1

Evaluate:
so here observe that the outer loop is running 4 times. In this we are printing like numbers, space, numbers

here we obersev that in 1st row we are printing 1 number then 6 spaces then again 1 number similary for all. one thing we can devise from this is the number is directly related to the row number


**Evaluate:**
- The pattern consists of two triangles, one increasing and one decreasing, mirrored along the vertical axis.
- The increasing triangle follows the same pattern as Example 3 (Numbered Increasing Triangle).
- The decreasing triangle follows the same pattern as Example 6 (Numbered Decreasing Triangle), but in reverse order.
- The number of elements in each row is equal to twice the row number, minus one.

so it is number space then number
for number: i
for space: 2*i-1
for number: i
1. How many rows are there? `n`
2. How many columns are there? `2*n-1` (in the last row)
3. What is the pattern? Mirrored triangle pattern
4. What is the symmetry? Vertically symmetric

**Code:**
```cpp
void mirroredTrianglePattern(int n) {
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
        // Increasing triangle
        for (int j = 1; j <= i; j++) {
            cout << j << " ";
        }

        // Space between the triangles
        for (int j = 1; j <= 2 * (n - i); j++) {
            cout << "  ";
        }

        // Decreasing triangle
        for (int j = i; j >= 1; j--) {
            cout << j << " ";
        }

        cout << endl;
    }
}

### Example: 13

Output:
1
2 3
4 5 6
7 8 9 10
11 12 13 14 15

Evaluate:
here we obersve that the inner loop is directly related to the row number. the starting point is 1. and then increasing by 1.

Code:
int num=1;
for(int i=1;i<=n;i++){
    for(int j=1;j<=i;j++){
        cout<<num<<" ";
        num++;
    }
    cout<<endl;
}

### Example 14:

Output:
A
AB
ABC
ABCD
ABCDE

Evaluate:
so in every row it starts with A and then 2 places jump


Code:
for (int i=0; i<n; i++) {
    for (char ch='A'; ch<='A'+i; ch++) {
        cout << ch << "";
    }
    cout << endl;
}

### Example 15:

Output:
ABCDE
ABCD
ABC
AB
A

Evaluate:
so in the first row it is A + 4 places then subsequently reducing it by 1


Code:
for (int i=0; i<n; i++) {
    for (char ch='A'; ch <='A' + (n-i-1); ch++) {
        cout << ch << "";
    }
    cout << endl;
}

Example 16:

Output:
A
BB
CCC
DDDD
EEEEE

Evaluate:
here we oberse that it is A = the row number wich is i

Code:
for (int i=0; i<n; i++) {
    char ch='A'+i;
    for(int j=0; j<=i; j++) {
        cout << ch << "";
     }
     cout << endl;
}
