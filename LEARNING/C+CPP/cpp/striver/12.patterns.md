# Understanding Patterns

## Nested Loops

1. The outer loop is for rows; here count the number of lines.
2. The inner loop is for columns; focus on the columns & somehow connect them to the rows.
3. Print whatever you are printing inside the inner loop.
4. Observe symmetry where required.

## Pattern Examples

### Example 1: Simple Square Pattern

**Output:**

```
* * * *
* * * *
* * * *
* * * *
```

**Evaluate:**
Here we observe that:

- in 0 row we get four '\*'
- 1st row we get four '\*'
- 2nd row we get four '\*'
- 3rd row we get four '\*'

1. How many rows are there? 4
2. How many columns are there? 4
3. What is the pattern? Square
4. What is the symmetry? Perfect square

**Code:**

```cpp
void squarePattern(int n) {
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            cout << "* ";
        }
        cout << endl;
    }
}
```

## Important Notes for Competitive Programming

1. In online CP compilers, it's common to create separate functions for each pattern rather than writing everything in the main function.
2. Consider multiple test cases:

   ```cpp
   #include <iostream>
   using namespace std;

   void patternFunction(int n) {
       // Pattern logic here
   }

   int main() {
       int t;
       cin >> t;
       while (t--) {
           int n;
           cin >> n;
           patternFunction(n);
       }
       return 0;
   }

   //OR

   int main() {
      int t;
      cin >> t;
      for (int i = 0; i < t; i++) {
        int n;
        cin >> n;
        // Call the pattern function here
      }
   }
   ```

3. The main function handles input/output, while the pattern logic is in separate functions.
4. Only the function output is visible to the user in the compiler.

### Example 7: Pyramid Pattern

```
    *
   ***
  *****
 *******
*********
```

**Evaluate:**
Let's understand this first. Now following rule 2 about connecting the columns to rows somehow:

- Here we observe that in 0 row we are printing 4 spaces, 1 '\*', and again 4 spaces
- 1st row we are printing 3 spaces, 3 '\*', and again 3 spaces
- 2nd row we are printing 2 spaces, 5 '\*', and again 2 spaces
- 3rd row we are printing 1 space, 7 '\*', and again 1 space
- 4th row we are printing 0 spaces, 9 '\*', and again 0 spaces

So it is space, stars, space:

- For space, we can use n-i-1
- For stars, we can use 2\*i+1
- Then again for space, we can use n-i-1
  Example: For n = 5 it will be 5-0-1 = 4 spaces and 2\*0+1 = 1 star and then again 5-0-1 = 4 spaces

        for (int j = 0; j < n - i - 1; j++) {
            cout << " ";
        }
        //star
        for (int j = 0; j < 2 * i + 1; j++) {
            cout << "*";
        }
        cout << endl;
    }
}
//OR
void pyramid(int n) {
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        //space
        for (int j = 0; j < n - i - 1; j++) {
            cout << " ";
        }
        //star
        for (int j = 0; j < 2 * i + 1; j++) {
            cout << "*";
        }
        //space
        for(int j = 0;  j<n-i-1; j++) {
            cout << " ";
        }
        cout << endl;
    }
}
```

### Example 8: Reverse Pyramid Pattern

- 3rd row we are printing 3 spaces, 3 '\*', and again 3 spaces
- 4th row we are printing 4 spaces, 1 '\*', and again 4 spaces

So it is space, stars, space:

- For space, we can use i
- For stars, we can use 2n-(2\*i+1)
- Then again for space, we can use i
  Example: For n=5 it will be 0 space then 2*5-(2*0+1) = 9 stars in the i=0 row and so on

1. How many rows are there? 5
2. How many columns are there? 9 (at the base)
3. What is the pattern? Pyramid
4. What is the symmetry? Centered pyramid

**Code:**

```cpp
void pyramid(int n) {
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        //space
        for (int j = 0; j < i; j++) {
            cout << " ";
        }
        //star
        for (int j = 0; j < 2*n - (2*i+1); j++) {
            cout << "*";
        }
        //space

            cout << " ";

        for (int j = 0; j < 2 * i + 1; j++) {
            cout << "*";
        }
        cout << endl;
    }

    // Print the Reverse Pyramid Pattern (second half)
    for (int i = n - 2; i >= 0; i--) {
        for (int j = 0; j < n - i - 1; j++) {
            cout << " ";

Additional Observations: This pattern is similar to the "Pyramid Pattern" (Example 7), but instead of printing stars, it prints alphabets in a palindromic fashion. The pattern consists of two parts:

- The first part is an increasing sequence of alphabets, starting from 'A' and incrementing by one in each subsequent column until the middle column.
- The second part is a decreasing sequence of alphabets, starting from the middle column and decrementing by one in each subsequent column until the end.

Implementation: To implement this pattern, we can follow a similar approach to the "Pyramid Pattern," but with some modifications:

- The outer loop runs for n rows.
- For each row, we first print the required number of spaces (n - i - 1).
- Then, we print the alphabets in the following manner:
  - We start with the character 'A'.
  - We have a breakpoint variable that represents the middle column index ((2 \* i + 1) / 2).
  - For each column index j from 1 to 2 \* i + 1:
    - If j is less than or equal to the breakpoint, we print the current character and increment it for the next iteration.
    - If j is greater than the breakpoint, we print the current character and decrement it for the next iteration.
- After printing the alphabets, we print the required number of spaces (n - i - 1) again.
- Finally, we move to the next line.

**Code:**

```cpp
void palindromicAlphabeticTriangle(int n) {
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        // Print spaces
        for (int j = 0; j < n - i - 1; j++) {
            cout << " ";
        }

        // Print alphabets
        char ch = 'A';
        int breakpoint = (2 * i + 1) / 2;
        for (int j = 1; j <= 2 * i + 1; j++) {
            cout << ch;
            if (j <= breakpoint) {
                ch++;
            } else {
                ch--;
            }
        }

        // Print spaces
        for (int j = 0; j < n - i - 1; j++) {
            cout << " ";
        }

        cout << endl;
    }
}
```

### Example 18: Reversed Alphabetic Triangle

**Output:**

```
E
DE
CDE
BCDE
ABCDE
```

**Evaluate:**

Here we observe that:

- In the 0th row, we get 'E'.
- In the 1st row, we get 'DE'.
- In the 2nd row, we get 'CDE'.
- In the 3rd row, we get 'BCDE'.
- In the 4th row, we get 'ABCDE'.

  1.How many rows are there? n (in this case, 5)
  2.How many columns are there? n (in this case, 5 in the last row)
  3.What is the pattern? Reversed alphabetic triangle
  4.What is the symmetry? Left-aligned triangle

Additional Observations:

- From the observation, we can see that the pattern starts from 'E' and decreases with respect to the row number i.
- If i=2, then 'E' would decrease up to two places, resulting in 'CDE'.
- This suggests that the outer loop will run n times, and the inner loop will start from 'E' - i up to the character 'E', incrementing by one each time.

**Code:**

```cpp
void reversedAlphabeticTriangle(int n) {
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        char start = 'E' - i;
        for (char ch = start; ch <= 'E'; ch++) {
            cout << ch;
        }
        cout << endl;
    }
}
```

### Example 19: Hollow Diamond Pattern

**Output:**

```
**********
****  ****
***    ***
**      **
*        *
*        *
**      **
***    ***
****  ****
**********
```

**Evaluate:**
Here we observe that:

- In the 0th row, we are printing 5 '_', 0 spaces, and again 5 '_'.
- In the 1st row, we are printing 4 '_', 2 spaces, and again 4 '_'.
- In the 2nd row, we are printing 3 '_', 4 spaces, and again 3 '_'.
- In the 3rd row, we are printing 2 '_', 6 spaces, and again 2 '_'.
- In the 4th row, we are printing 1 '_', 8 spaces, and again 1 '_'.

  1.How many rows are there? 2n-1 (in this case, 9)
  2.How many columns are there? 2n-1 (in this case, 9 in the widest row)
  3.What is the pattern? Hollow diamond pattern
  4.What is the symmetry? Vertically and horizontally symmetric

Additional Observations:
From the first look, we can observe that this is a mirrored set. Let's figure out the first set, then:

- The outer loop is definitely running for n times.
- We will be printing stars, spaces, and stars again.
- For the stars, we print n - i stars.
- For the spaces, we start with 0 spaces and increment by 2 for every row.
- After the spaces, we print n - i stars again.

That's the first half. Now, upon the second half part, which is the mirror of the above:

- In the 5th row, we are printing 1 '_', 8 spaces, and again 1 '_'.
- In the 6th row, we are printing 2 '_', 6 spaces, and again 2 '_'.
- In the 7th row, we are printing 3 '_', 4 spaces, and again 3 '_'.
- In the 8th row, we are printing 4 '_', 2 spaces, and again 4 '_'.
- In the 9th row, we are printing 5 '_', 0 spaces, and again 5 '_'.

So, again, we will be printing stars, spaces, and stars again:

- For the stars, we print i stars.
- For the spaces, we start with 8 spaces and decrement by 2 for every row.
- After the spaces, we print i stars again.

**Code:**

```cpp
void hollowDiamondPattern(int n) {
    int space = 0;
    //First set
    for(int i=0; i<n; i++) {
        //stars
        for(int j=1; i<=n-i; j++) {
            cout << "*";
        }
        //spaces
        for(int j=0; j<space; j++) {
            cout << " ";
        }
        //stars
        for(int j=1; i<=n-i; j++) {
            cout << "*";
        }
        space +=2;
        cout << endl;
    }
    //Second set
    space = 2*n-2;
    for(int i=1; i<=n; i++) {
        //stars
        for(int j=1; j<=i; j++) {
            cout << "*";
        }
        //spaces
        for(int j=1; j<=space; j++) {
            cout << " ";
        }
        //stars
        for(int j=1; j<=i; j++) {
            cout << "*";
        }
        space -=2;
        cout << endl;
    }
//OR
    //First set
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        //stars
        for (int j = 0; j < n - i; j++) {
            cout << "*";
        }
        //spaces
        for (int j = 0; j < 2 * i; j++) {
            cout << " ";
        }
        //stars
        for (int j = 0; j < n - i; j++) {
            cout << "*";
        }
        cout << endl;
    }
    //Second set
    for (int i = n - 2; i >= 0; i--) {
        //stars
        for (int j = 0; j < i + 1; j++) {
            cout << "*";
        }
        //spaces
        for (int j = 0; j < 2 * (n - i - 1); j++) {
            cout << " ";
        }
        //stars
        for (int j = 0; j < i + 1; j++) {
            cout << "*";
        }
        cout << endl;
    }
}
```

### Example 20: X-Wing (Similar to Example 10.1)

Output:

```
*        *
**      **
***    ***
****  ****
**********
****  ****
***    ***
**      **
*        *
```

**Evaluate:**

- This is a variation of Example 10.1. The only difference is that the spaces between the stars are now variable. The number of spaces between the stars is equal to the number of stars on the opposite side of the star.

Here we observe that:

- In the 0th row, we are printing 1 '_', 8 spaces, and again 1 '_'
- In the 1st row, we are printing 2 '_', 6 spaces, and again 2 '_'
- In the 2nd row, we are printing 3 '_', 4 spaces, and again 3 '_'
- In the 3rd row, we are printing 4 '_', 2 spaces, and again 4 '_'
- In the 4th row, we are printing 5 '_', 0 spaces, and again 5 '_'
- In the 5th row, we are printing 4 '_', 2 spaces, and again 4 '_'
- In the 6th row, we are printing 3 '_', 4 spaces, and again 3 '_'
- In the 7th row, we are printing 2 '_', 6 spaces, and again 2 '_'
- In the 8th row, we are printing 1 '_', 8 spaces, and again 1 '_'

1.How many rows are there?
2.How many columns are there?
3.What is the pattern?
4.What is the symmetry?

Additional Observations:
so from the start we can see that the outer loop runs for exactly 2n-1 times and the stars printing rate is directly related to that of the row number till the pivot point after the 5th row(or 4th row if i=0) there is a pivot suddenly where the space starts to incremnets and the stars starts to decrement at the rate of 2n-1

**Code:**

```cpp
void xWingPattern(int n) {
    itn spaces=2*n-2;
    for(int i=1; i<=2; i++) {
        int stars=i;
        if(i>n) stars=2*n-i;
        //stars
        for(int j=1; j<=stars; j++) {
            cout<<"*";
        }
        //spaces
        for(int j=1; j<=spaces; j++) {
            cout<<" ";
        }
        //stars
        for(int j=1; j<=stars; j++) {
            cout<<"*";
        }
    }
    cout << endl;
    if(i<n) spaces-=2;
    else spaces+=2;
}
//OR
    for (int i = 0; i < 2 * n - 1; i++) {
        int stars = i < n ? i + 1 : 2 * n - i - 1;
        int spaces = 2 * (n - stars);
        //stars
        for (int j = 0; j < stars; j++) {
            cout << "*";
        }
        //spaces
        for (int j = 0; j < spaces; j++) {
            cout << " ";
        }
        //stars
        for (int j = 0; j < stars; j++) {
            cout << "*";
        }
    cout << endl;
}
```

### Example 21: Hollow Square Pattern
**Output:**
```

```

**Evaluate:**
Here we observe that:

- In the 0th row, we are printing 2 '_', 0 spaces, and again 2 '_'
- In the 1st row, we are printing 1 '_', 2 spaces, and again 1 '_'
- In the 2nd row, we are printing 1 '_', 2 spaces, and again 1 '_'
- In the 3rd row, we are printing 2 '\*', 2 spaces, and again

1.How many rows are there?
2.How many columns are there?
3.What is the pattern?
4.What is the symmetry?

Additonal Observation:
from the first hand we can clearly see that it is sqaure shaped which means the stars are only printed at the boundary that is that they start from 0 and go till n-1 same for both column and rows.

**Code:**
```cpp
void hollowSquarePattern(int n) {
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            if (i == 0 || i == n - 1 || j == 0 || j == n - 1) {
                cout << "*";
            } else {
                cout << " ";
            }
        }
        cout << endl;
    }
}
```

### Example 22:
**Output:**
```
4 4 4 4 4 4 4
4 3 3 3 3 3 4
4 3 2 2 2 3 4
4 3 2 1 2 3 4
4 3 2 2 2 3 4
4 3 3 3 3 3 4

```

**Evaluate:**
Here we observe that:
- In the 0th row, we are printing
