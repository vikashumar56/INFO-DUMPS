## What is Docker Compose?

- Docker Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications.
- With Compose, you use a YAML file to configure your application's services.
- Then, with a single command, you create and start all the services from your configuration.

### Before docker-compose

- Before docker-compose, we had to run each container separately.
- We had to run the `docker run` command for each container.
- We had to specify the ports, volumes, and networks for each container.

### After Docker Compose File

- With Docker Compose, we can define all the services in a single file.
- We can define the ports, volumes, and networks for each container in the same file.
- We can run all the services with a single command.

## Using Docker Compose

1. Installing Docker Compose

   - Docker Compose is included with Docker Desktop for Windows and macOS.
   - For Linux, you can download the Docker Compose binary from the [release page](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/linux-install/)
     <br>

2. Create a `docker-compose.yml` file in the root directory of your project. (In our case, it's the `base-image` directory)
   <br>

3. Define the services in the `docker-compose.yml` file.

   ```yaml
   version: '3.8'
   services:
   mongodb:
     image: mongo
     container_name: 100x-mongo
     ports:
       - '27017:27017'
     volumes:
       - 100x-mongo-data:/data/db

   backend_app:
     image: 100x-node
     container_name: 100x-node
     depends_on:
       - mongodb
     ports:
       - '3000:3000'
     environment:
     MONGO_URL: 'mongodb://100x-mongo:27017/100x-db'
   volumes:
     100x-mongo-data:
   ```

<br>

4. Build the base image from the `base-image` directory.

   ```bash
   docker build -t 100x-node .
   ```

5. To start all the services, run:

   ```bash
   docker-compose up
   ```

6. To stop all the services, run:
   ```bash
   docker-compose down
   ```
